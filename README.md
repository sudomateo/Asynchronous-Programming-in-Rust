This is the code repository for [Asynchronous Programming in Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/product/asynchronous-programming-in-rust/9781805128137), published by Packt.

**Learn asynchronous programming by building working examples of futures, green threads, and runtimes**

## What is this book about?
Explore the nuances of transitioning from high-level languages to Rust with this book. Navigate potential frustrations arising from differences in modeling asynchronous program flow and recognize the need for a fundamental understanding of the topic.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the essence of asynchronous program flow and its significance
* Understand the difference between concurrency and parallelism
* Gain insights into how computers and operating systems handle concurrent tasks
* Uncover the mechanics of async/await
* Understand Rust’s futures by implementing them yourself
* Implement green threads from scratch to thoroughly understand them

If you feel this book is for you, get your [copy](https://www.amazon.com/Asynchronous-Programming-Rust-asynchronous-programming/dp/1805128132/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NQEFXDPADDSG&keywords=asynchronous+programming+in+rust&qid=1707141670&sprefix=asynchronous+programming+in+r%2Caps%2C313&sr=8-1) today!

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
pub trait Future {
type Output;
fn poll(&mut self) -> PollState<Self::Output>;
}

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is for programmers who want to enhance their understanding of asynchronous programming, especially those experienced in VM’ed or interpreted languages like C#, Java, Python, JavaScript, and Go. If you work with C or C++ but have had limited exposure to asynchronous programming, this book serves as a resource to broaden your knowledge in this area.
Although the examples are predominantly in Rust, the intricacies of Rust’s futures are covered in detail. So, anyone with a keen interest in learning Rust or with working knowledge of Rust will be able to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-10).
### Software and Hardware List

## Get to Know the Author
**Carl Fredrik Samson** is a popular technical writer, and his favorite topics to write about are asynchronous programming and Rust. During a period of 3 years, Carl set out to cover topics about asynchronous programming that he felt were severely under explained and tried to explain them in an informal and easy to understand manner. The bits and pieces he wrote were popular and translated to several languages. Some even ended up as parts of the official Asynchronous Programming in Rust book. Now, he has decided to put his combined works and knowledge into a book of its own. Carl has programmed since the early 1990s, has a Master in Strategy and Finance, and he has written production software for both his own business and as a hobby for over a decade.
